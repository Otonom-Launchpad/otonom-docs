# Otonom Fund - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Otonom Fund project, focusing on creating a simplified version that demonstrates the end-to-end user journey for the Solana Colosseum Breakout Hackathon. The resulting Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from this plan is deployed and accessible at: **[https://pad.otonom.fund](https://pad.otonom.fund)**.
(For main project information, litepaper, and pitch deck, please visit **[https://otonom.fund](https://otonom.fund)**).

## Core User Journey

The core user journey we need to implement is:

1. **Discovery**: Users explore curated AI projects
2. **Account Creation**: Users connect their Solana wallet
3. **Tier Selection**: Users choose investment tier (1, 2, or 3)
4. **Investment**: Users acquire $OFUND tokens
5. **Project Selection**: Users browse and select AI projects
6. **Fund Allocation**: Users invest in specific projects
7. **Token Receipt**: Users receive project tokens immediately
8. **Portfolio Tracking**: Users monitor investments through dashboard

## Implementation Phases

We'll implement the project in the following phases, focusing on creating a simplified version first and then adding more details if time permits.

- Fix bugs and issues
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

#### Task 5.2: Polishing
- Improve UI/UX
- Add animations and transitions
- Optimize performance

### Phase 6: Community Building & Engagement

#### Task 6.1: Establish Initial Online Presence
- Set up/Maintain core social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn Company Page, Telegram placeholder).
- Draft introductory bio and project summaries for social platforms.

#### Task 6.2: Content & Outreach Preparation
- Draft initial announcement posts/threads about Otonom Fund and its mission.
- Identify relevant Solana/AI/startup communities for potential future outreach.
- Prepare a brief outline of a community engagement strategy for post-hackathon development.

### Phase 7: Documentation and Submission

#### Task 7.1: Documentation
- Create user documentation
- Write technical documentation
- Prepare presentation materials

#### Task 7.2: Hackathon Submission
- Prepare submission materials
- Create demo video
- Submit project

## Simplified Implementation Approach

To create a simplified version that demonstrates the end-to-end user journey, we'll focus on:

### 1. Simplified Tier System
- Instead of complex smart contracts, use simple flags or checks based on wallet balance
- Implement basic tier visualization without complex functionality

### 2. Simplified Investment Flow
- Use direct token transfers without complex vesting schedules
- Implement immediate token receipt without additional checks

### 3. Simplified Portfolio Tracking
- Show basic investment information without complex analytics
- Display project tokens and investment amounts

### 4. Simplified Project Listing
- Use static data for project listing
- Implement basic filtering and sorting

## Feature Prioritization

1. **Must-Have Features** (for MVP):
   - Wallet connection (Phantom)
   - Project listing and details
   - Tier selection
   - Basic investment flow
   - Simple portfolio dashboard

2. **Nice-to-Have Features** (if time permits):
   - Advanced tier system with smart contracts
   - Complex investment flow with vesting schedules
   - Advanced portfolio analytics
   - Project filtering and sorting
   - User notifications

3. **Future Features** (post-hackathon):
   - Multi-chain support
   - Advanced analytics
   - Social features
   - **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Development**: Phased implementation of governance smart contracts, token-based voting systems, and on-chain treasury management to transition Otonom Fund to full community governance.
   - Mobile app

## Technical Simplifications

1. **Frontend**:
   - Use simple state management (React Context) instead of complex state management libraries
   - Implement basic responsive design without complex animations
   - Use shadcn UI components for faster development

2. **Backend**:
   - Use Supabase for both authentication and database
   - Implement basic API services without complex caching
   - Use simple data models

3. **Blockchain**:
   - Use simple SPL token without complex tokenomics
   - Implement basic smart contracts without complex logic
   - Use direct token transfers without complex mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Follow the setup guide to set up all environments
2. Implement the core features in order of priority
3. Test and polish the implementation
4. Prepare for hackathon submission

By following this implementation plan, we'll be able to create a simplified version of the Otonom Fund platform that demonstrates the end-to-end user journey for the Solana Colosseum Breakout Hackathon.
